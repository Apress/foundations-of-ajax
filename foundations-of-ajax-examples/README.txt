                   EXAMPLES FROM "FOUNDATIONS OF AJAX"
================================================================================

Last Updated: 23 November 2005


Thank you for your interest in "Foundations of Ajax." We hope you find the book
and these examples useful tools for learning Ajax and its related techniques.

Included in this download is the source code for the examples from the book. 
The examples can be run in any J2EE 1.3 servlet container like Jakarta Tomcat.
All of the pre-built WAR files were compiled against JDK 1.4, thus JDK 1.4 or
newer is required to run them.

The source code is divided by chapter. Inside of each chapter folder is a 
directory named "dist." Within the dist directory is the pre-built WAR file
that can be deployed to Tomcat or other servlet container. Each chapter folder 
also contains a build.xml file from which the WAR file can be built using Ant.
Use the dist target to compile the sources and build the WAR file:

> ant dist

Each chapter WAR file has an index file that points to the individual examples
within that chapter.  Access the index file using a URL similar to the
following, making sure to use the desired chapter number and the correct
port number for your servlet container:

http://localhost/Chapter02/

Users of the NetBeans IDE will notice that each chapter folder contains a
directory named nbproject, making each chapter folder a native NetBeans project. 
Each chapter folder can be opened in the NetBeans IDE version 4.1 or newer.

You may contact us via email at foundationsofajax@gmail.com with any questions
regarding the source code.

Thank you and good luck!
